# Rust Learning Project

Welcome to the **Rust Learning Project**! This repository is designed to help you learn the Rust programming language through hands-on examples and exercises. Whether you're new to Rust or looking to deepen your understanding, this project provides a structured approach to get you familiar with the syntax, concepts, and best practices of Rust.

## Introduction

This project is a collection of exercises, example programs, and learning materials to guide you through Rust. It covers a wide range of topics, from basic syntax to more advanced topics like ownership, concurrency, and error handling.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several modules, each focusing on a specific aspect of the Rust language:

```
├── basics
│   ├── variables.rs
│   ├── functions.rs
│   ├── control_flow.rs
├── ownership_and_borrowing
│   ├── ownership.rs
│   ├── borrowing.rs
├── error_handling
│   ├── result.rs
│   ├── option.rs
├── concurrency
│   ├── threads.rs
│   ├── async.rs
└── README.md
```

- **basics/**: Covers basic Rust concepts like variables, functions, and control flow.
- **ownership_and_borrowing/**: Focuses on Rust's unique ownership and borrowing rules.
- **error_handling/**: Introduces error handling mechanisms using `Result` and `Option`.
- **concurrency/**: Covers Rust's concurrency model, including threads and async programming.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Rust**: You can install Rust by following the official installation guide at [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **Cargo**: Cargo is Rust's package manager and is included with the Rust installation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rust-learning-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd rust-learning-project
    ```

3. Build the project (optional for Rust projects):

    ```bash
    cargo build
    ```

## How to Run

Each module contains separate Rust files that can be run individually. To run any of the examples, use the following command:

```bash
cargo run --bin <file_name>
```

For example, to run the variables example:

```bash
cargo run --bin basics/variables.rs
```

Alternatively, you can directly use `rustc` to compile and run a specific Rust file:

```bash
rustc basics/variables.rs
./variables
```
